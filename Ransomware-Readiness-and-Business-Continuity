# Checklist: The Ransomware Readiness & Recovery Plan

For a small business, a ransomware attack isn't a tech problemâ€”it's a financial catastrophe. This checklist, based on CIS Control 10, is designed to ensure your business can **survive and recover** from a worst-case scenario without paying a ransom.

### Phase 1: Proactive Hardening (Making Your Business a Tough Target)

- [ ] **Automate OS & Application Patching:** Is every computer set to automatically update its operating system (Windows/macOS) and web browsers? Attackers exploit old software; this closes the door.
- [ ] **Restrict Administrative Privileges:** Are you and your employees operating as "Standard" users for daily work, not "Administrators"? This one step contains an attack and prevents malware from taking over the whole system.
- [ ] **Secure Your Email Gateway:** Is your email system configured to scan for and block malicious attachments and links *before* they reach your inbox? This is your #1 defense against phishing, the primary entry point for ransomware.

### Phase 2: The Ultimate Safety Net (The 'Survive Anything' Backup Strategy)

This is the most critical phase. A working backup is the difference between a bad day and a dead business.

- [ ] **Implement the 3-2-1 Backup Rule:** Do you have **3** copies of your essential data, on **2** different types of media, with **1** of those copies stored **offsite** (e.g., in the cloud or a different physical location)?
- [ ] **Ensure Backup Immutability/Offline Status:** Is your offsite backup "immutable" or "offline"? This means a hacker who has compromised your network cannot also delete or encrypt your backups. (Many cloud backup services offer this).
- [ ] **Schedule and Verify Backup Tests:** Have you successfully restored a test file from your backup within the last 90 days? An untested backup is not a real backup.

### Phase 3: "In Case of Emergency" Plan (Don't Panic, Execute)

- [ ] **Create an Incident Contact List:** Do you have a printed or offline list with the contact information for your IT support, a cybersecurity incident response firm, and your cyber insurance provider?
- [ ] **Know the First Move:** Has everyone been instructed that the first step when ransomware is suspected is to immediately **disconnect the computer from the network** (unplug the ethernet cable or turn off Wi-Fi)? This prevents it from spreading to other computers and your backups.
