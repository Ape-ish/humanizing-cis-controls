# Inventory of Assets

> **CIS Controls 1 & 2** – “Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets” and “Inventory and Control of Software Assets” – lay the groundwork for all other controls by ensuring you know what hardware and software you own and manage.

This outline explains the importance of maintaining an accurate inventory.  A detailed post will describe practical discovery methods and tools, plus tips for keeping inventories current.

## Outline

1. **Identify Hardware Assets**
   - List all devices: servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, IoT and network equipment.
   - Include device details such as make, model, OS and ownership.
2. **Identify Software Assets**
   - Catalog installed applications, versions and licensing information.
   - Identify unauthorized or end‑of‑life software for removal.
3. **Automate Discovery**
   - Use asset management tools to scan networks and endpoints.
   - Integrate with configuration management databases (CMDBs) where available.
4. **Maintain and Audit**
   - Establish processes for updating inventories when assets are added, changed or retired.
   - Conduct periodic audits to validate accuracy.
5. **Leverage the Inventory**
   - Cross‑reference with vulnerability scans and patch management.
   - Support incident response and legal compliance (e.g., licensing agreements).

Future work will provide sample asset inventory templates, open‑source discovery tools and integration tips for small businesses.
