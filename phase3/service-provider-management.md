# Service Provider Management

> **CIS Control 15** – “Service Provider Management” – focuses on ensuring that third‑party vendors and service providers meet your security requirements and do not introduce unacceptable risk.

This outline introduces the key considerations when selecting, managing and offboarding service providers.  A comprehensive post will offer contract clauses, assessment checklists and monitoring strategies.

## Outline

1. **Identify Service Providers**
   - Catalog all vendors who process, store or transmit your data (cloud providers, SaaS applications, MSPs).
   - Classify providers based on criticality and data sensitivity.
2. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate providers' security controls using questionnaires, certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) and penetration tests where appropriate.
   - Review breach history and incident response capabilities.
3. **Define Contractual Requirements**
   - Include data protection, confidentiality, breach notification and right‑to‑audit clauses in contracts.
   - Specify minimum security standards and reporting obligations.
4. **Monitor and Review**
   - Perform periodic risk assessments of providers.
   - Monitor service level agreements (SLAs) and compliance with security requirements.
5. **Termination and Offboarding**
   - Ensure data return or destruction when contracts end.
   - Revoke access and remove credentials associated with the provider.

We will flesh out these sections with sample questionnaires, template clauses and guidance on conducting provider due diligence.
