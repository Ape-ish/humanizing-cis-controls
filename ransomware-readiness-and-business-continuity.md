# Checklist: The Ransomware Readiness & Recovery Plan

For a small business, a ransomware attack isn't just a tech problem—it can be a financial catastrophe.  This checklist, based on **CIS Control 10**, is designed to ensure your business can **survive and recover** from a worst‑case scenario without paying a ransom.

## Phase 1: Proactive Hardening (Making Your Business a Tough Target)

- [ ] **Automate OS & Application Patching:** Are all computers set to automatically update their operating system (Windows/macOS) and web browsers?  Attackers exploit old software; keeping everything up‑to‑date closes the door.
- [ ] **Restrict Administrative Privileges:** Are you and your employees operating as *standard* users for daily work, not *administrators*?  Limiting privileges contains an attack and prevents malware from taking over the whole system.
- [ ] **Secure Your Email Gateway:** Is your email system configured to scan for and block malicious attachments and links *before* they reach your inbox?  This is your #1 defense against phishing, the primary entry point for ransomware.

## Phase 2: The Ultimate Safety Net (The ‘Survive Anything’ Backup Strategy)

This is the most critical phase.  A working backup is the difference between a bad day and a dead business.

- [ ] **Implement the 3‑2‑1 Backup Rule:** Do you have **3** copies of your essential data on **2** different types of media, with **1** of those copies stored **offsite** (e.g. in the cloud or a different physical location)?
- [ ] **Ensure Backup Immutability/Offline Status:** Is your offsite backup “immutable” or “offline”?  This means a hacker who has compromised your network cannot also delete or encrypt your backups.  Many cloud backup services offer this.
- [ ] **Schedule and Verify Backup Tests:** Have you successfully restored a test file from your backup within the last 90 days?  An untested backup is not a real backup.

## Phase 3: “In Case of Emergency” Plan (Don't Panic – Execute)

- [ ] **Create an Incident Contact List:** Do you have a printed or offline list with the contact information for your IT support, a cybersecurity incident response firm and your cyber‑insurance provider?
- [ ] **Know the First Move:** Has everyone been instructed that the first step when ransomware is suspected is to immediately **disconnect the computer from the network** (unplug the ethernet cable or turn off Wi‑Fi)?  This prevents it from spreading to other computers and your backups.
