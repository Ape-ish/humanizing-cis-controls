# Data Protection

> **CIS Control 3** – “Data Protection” – ensures that sensitive information is safeguarded wherever it resides or travels.

This outline identifies essential practices for protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.  A comprehensive guide will examine encryption, data classification and privacy considerations.

## Outline

1. **Identify and Classify Data**
   - Determine what data is sensitive or regulated (PII, PHI, IP, financial records).
   - Label data according to its classification (public, internal, confidential, secret).
2. **Encrypt Data at Rest**
   - Use full‑disk encryption for laptops and servers.
   - Employ database and file‑level encryption as appropriate.
3. **Encrypt Data in Transit**
   - Enforce TLS for web services and email.
   - Secure file transfers using SFTP or HTTPS.
4. **Control Access to Data**
   - Implement role‑based access controls.
   - Apply the principle of least privilege for file shares and databases.
5. **Monitor Data Usage and Movement**
   - Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to detect and block unauthorized transfers.
   - Log and audit access to sensitive files.
6. **Comply with Regulations**
   - Understand relevant data protection laws (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA).
   - Maintain records of processing activities and respond to data subject requests.

In future revisions, we will provide example encryption toolkits, policy templates and case studies on successful data protection implementations.
