## About This Project

This repository is the central hub for the "Humanizing CIS Controls" series. The official [CIS Critical Security Controls®](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) are a prioritized and globally recognized set of best practices to defend against the most common cyber attacks. While they are an incredible resource, their technical nature can sometimes be a barrier for those outside of dedicated cybersecurity roles.

The mission of this project is to translate these critical safeguards into plain language. We'll break down each control, explore the "why" behind it, and provide practical examples of how these concepts apply in the real world—not just for IT professionals, but for small business owners, students, and anyone looking to improve their cyber hygiene.

## The CIS Controls Series

## Our Learning Roadmap: The "Humanizing CIS Controls" Series

We aren't following the official 1-18 order. Instead, we've designed a logical learning path that starts with immediate, high-impact "quick wins" and builds from there. This makes cybersecurity more approachable and helps you build a strong foundation first.
