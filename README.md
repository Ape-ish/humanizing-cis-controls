## About This Project

This repository is the central hub for the "Humanizing CIS Controls" series. The official [CIS Critical Security Controls®](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) are a prioritized and globally recognized set of best practices to defend against the most common cyber attacks. While they are an incredible resource, their technical nature can sometimes be a barrier for those outside of dedicated cybersecurity roles.

The mission of this project is to translate these critical safeguards into plain language. We'll break down each control, explore the "why" behind it, and provide practical examples of how these concepts apply in the real world—not just for IT professionals, but for small business owners, students, and anyone looking to improve their cyber hygiene.

## Supplementary Materials & Deeper Dives

Beyond the core controls, this project will also explore related concepts and resources from the [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) to provide a more complete picture of modern cyber defense.

* ### CIS Community Defense Model (CDM)
    * The CDM is a data-driven model that shows how the CIS Controls are effective against the top five most prevalent attack types, including Malware and Ransomware.
    * [Link to your file explaining the CDM]

* ### Living off the Land (LotL) Attacks
    * Attackers often use legitimate tools already on a system to carry out an attack, making them difficult to detect. This section will explore CIS guidance on defending against the abuse of common tools.
    * **Scheduled Tasks**: A common technique used by attackers to automate malicious activities for persistence or lateral movement.
        * [Link to your file on Scheduled Tasks]
    * **PowerShell**: A powerful administrative tool that is frequently abused by cyber threat actors.
        * [Link to your file on PowerShell]
    * **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**: A native Windows tool used for reconnaissance, code execution, and persistence.
        * [Link to your file on WMI]
