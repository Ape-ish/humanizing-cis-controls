## About This Project

The [CIS Critical Security Controls®](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) are a prioritized and globally recognized set of best practices to defend against the most common cyber attacks. While they are an incredible resource, their technical nature can sometimes be a barrier for those outside of dedicated cybersecurity roles.

The mission of this project is to **translate these critical safeguards into plain language**. We break down each control, explore the “why” behind it, and provide practical examples of how these concepts apply in the real world—not just for IT professionals, but for small business owners, students and anyone looking to improve their cyber hygiene.
