## About This Project

The [CISÂ CriticalÂ SecurityÂ ControlsÂ®](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) are a prioritized and globally recognized set of best practices to defend against the most common cyber attacks.

This repository's mission is to **translate these critical safeguards into plain language** for small offices, home users, and learnersâ€”without losing the "why" or technical impact behind the scenes.
