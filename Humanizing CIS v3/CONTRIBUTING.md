# Contributing to Humanizing the CIS Controls

Thank you for your interest in improving this project!  We welcome contributions of all kinds—new content, corrections, translations, feedback and more.  To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow the guidelines below.

## How to Propose Changes

1. **Discuss first (optional but encouraged).**  If you plan to make substantial changes or add new posts, please open an issue to describe your idea.  This allows the community to provide feedback and avoid duplicate efforts.
2. **Fork the repository.**  Click the “Fork” button on GitHub and create a copy of this project under your account.
3. **Create a branch.**  Name your branch descriptively, such as `feature/email-outline` or `fix/typo-level2`.
4. **Make your changes.**  See the sections below for style and structure guidance.  Test your changes locally (markdown preview) to ensure that links work and formatting looks good.
5. **Submit a pull request.**  Include a clear description of what you changed and why.  Reference any related issues.  We’ll review and provide feedback as soon as possible.

## Style Guidelines

* **Tone:** Write in a friendly, conversational tone without jargon.  Assume the reader has basic computer literacy but may not be a technical expert.
* **Consistency:** Use “anti‑malware” consistently instead of “antivirus” unless referring to a specific product.  Use sentence case for headings and hyphenated, lower‑case filenames.
* **Accessibility:** Provide alternative text (“alt text”) for any images.  Avoid embedding large tables of text; keep tables for concise data and lists for detailed explanations.
* **Attribution:** When citing external resources, link to the original source when possible and respect licenses.  Do not copy proprietary content verbatim.

## File and Folder Structure

* **Phases:** Posts are organized by phase (`phase1/`, `phase2/`, `phase3/`).  New posts should be placed in the appropriate phase folder.
* **File names:** Use hyphen‑lowercase file names (e.g., `email-and-web-browser-protections.md`).
* **Images:** Place any images or diagrams in an `assets/` subfolder inside the relevant phase (e.g., `phase1/assets/diagram.png`) and reference them with relative paths.  Include a descriptive alt text.
* **New phases:** If you are contributing to “Pro Tools” or “Advanced Concepts,” create a new top‑level folder (e.g., `pro-tools/`) following the same naming conventions.

## Adding Translations

We welcome translations!  Create a new folder named with the language code (e.g., `es/` for Spanish) and replicate the directory structure inside.  Include a `README.md` in that folder explaining the translation and crediting translators.  Please ensure that translations maintain the original meaning and tone.

## Code of Conduct

This project is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.  By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).  Harassment or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
