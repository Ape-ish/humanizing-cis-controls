# Continuous Vulnerability Management

> **CIS Control 7** – “Continuous Vulnerability Management” – is about identifying, prioritizing and remediating software flaws before attackers can exploit them.

This outline sketches the key components of an effective vulnerability management program.  A more detailed post will offer specific tools, workflows and examples.

## Outline

1. **Discover What You Have**
   - Maintain an up‑to‑date inventory of hardware and software assets (ties back to CIS Controls 1 & 2).
2. **Scan Regularly**
   - Schedule automated scans (e.g., weekly or after major changes).
   - Use both authenticated and unauthenticated scans to capture different perspectives.
3. **Prioritize Findings**
   - Understand CVSS scores and contextual risk (exposed services, business impact).
   - Create a remediation SLA based on severity levels.
4. **Remediate and Verify**
   - Patch or mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
   - Re‑scan to confirm fixes.
5. **Integrate with Change Management**
   - Coordinate vulnerability management with your patch management and change control processes.
6. **Communicate and Report**
   - Track trends over time and report to stakeholders.
