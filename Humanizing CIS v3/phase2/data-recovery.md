# Data Recovery

> **CIS Control 11** – “Data Recovery” – emphasizes the importance of reliable backups and the ability to restore business operations after an incident.

This outline summarises the core principles of data recovery planning.  The full post will explore backup technologies, testing strategies and how to integrate recovery procedures into daily operations.

## Outline

1. **Define Recovery Requirements**
   - Identify critical systems and data.
   - Establish Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
2. **Design Your Backup Strategy**
   - Adopt the 3‑2‑1 rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite).
   - Evaluate backup types: full, incremental, differential and image‑based.
3. **Implement and Automate Backups**
   - Use backup software or services suited to your environment (cloud vs. on‑premises).
   - Schedule backups and ensure they complete successfully.
4. **Test and Validate**
   - Conduct regular restore tests to verify backups are usable.
   - Document lessons learned and refine processes.
5. **Secure Your Backups**
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
   - Restrict access to backup locations and keys.

Upcoming sections will include sample backup plans, recommended tools and incident response playbooks.
