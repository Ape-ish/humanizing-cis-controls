# Emergency Malware Cleanup Plan

Is your computer slow, acting weird, or flooded with pop‑ups? Don't panic, and don't throw it out.  Follow this 3‑step emergency plan based on **CIS Control 10** to take back control.

## Step 1: Isolate the Patient (≈ 2 minutes)

**Goal:** trap the malware and stop it from spreading or calling home.

- [ ] **Disconnect from the Internet:** Unplug your ethernet cable or turn off your computer’s Wi‑Fi.  This severs the malware’s connection to command‑and‑control servers and prevents it from exfiltrating data.
- [ ] **Restart in Safe Mode with Networking:**
  - **Windows 10/11:** Hold **Shift** while you click *Restart*.  Navigate to *Troubleshoot → Advanced options → Startup Settings → Restart*.  When it reboots, press **5** for “Safe Mode with Networking.”
  - In Safe Mode, Windows loads only essential drivers.  Most malware is not configured to run in this environment, making it easier to remove.

*Why this matters:* Isolation buys you time.  By cutting off network access, you stop malware from spreading to other devices or encrypting network shares.  Safe Mode reduces the number of services running, limiting the malware’s ability to defend itself or hide.

## Step 2: Scan and Destroy (≈ 10 minutes)

**Goal:** find and remove the malicious files.

- [ ] **Run Your Primary Anti‑Malware:** In Safe Mode, open your main anti‑malware program (e.g., Windows Defender).  Run a **full** scan (not a quick scan).  Allow it to remove or quarantine anything it detects.
- [ ] **Get a Second Opinion:** Malware can be sneaky.  Open a web browser (Safe Mode with Networking allows this) and download a free, reputable on‑demand scanner such as Malwarebytes Free.  Install and run its scan.  Remove everything it finds.

*Why this matters:* Different engines catch different threats.  A full scan examines every file and process, which takes longer but is more thorough.  Using two independent scanners increases the chance of catching elusive malware that your primary tool might miss.

## Step 3: Reboot and Harden (≈ 3 minutes)

**Goal:** get back to normal and prevent this from happening again.

- [ ] **Restart Your Computer Normally:** It should now be much faster and cleaner if the malware has been removed.
- [ ] **Verify Your Anti‑Malware:** Ensure your primary security software is enabled and configured for automatic updates.  This helps catch any future threats promptly.
- [ ] **Uninstall Suspicious Programs:** Go to **Add or Remove Programs** (Windows) or **Applications** (macOS) and uninstall software you don’t recognize or no longer need.  Unwanted programs can reinstall malware or open backdoors.
- [ ] **Change Critical Passwords:** Assume the malware captured your credentials.  On a separate, trusted device (like your smartphone), change passwords for your email, banking and social media accounts.  Enable multi‑factor authentication where available.
- [ ] **Disable USB Autorun:** Follow the [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/help/967715) or [Apple](https://support.apple.com/) documentation to turn off Autorun/Autoplay.  This prevents malware on a USB stick from automatically launching.

*Why this matters:* Rebooting ensures the system loads clean.  Hardening closes gaps the malware exploited: updated security tools, removed unwanted software, strong passwords and disabling autorun.  Changing passwords on a separate device prevents keyloggers from stealing your new credentials.  These steps collectively reduce the chance of reinfection.
