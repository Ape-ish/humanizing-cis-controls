# Security Awareness and Skills Training

> **CIS Control 14** – “Security Awareness and Skills Training” – recognizes that technology alone cannot stop cyber threats; people need to understand risks and know how to respond.

This outline provides a framework for educating yourself and your team about cybersecurity.  A full article will include ready‑to‑use training materials and exercises.

## Why Awareness Matters

Humans are often called the “weakest link,” but with the right knowledge and habits they become a powerful defense layer.  Training reduces the likelihood of falling for phishing scams, mishandling data or introducing malware.

## Outline

1. **Define Objectives**
   - Identify the key behaviors and knowledge areas your audience needs (e.g., phishing recognition, data handling).
   - Tailor training to different roles (executive, technical, non‑technical).
2. **Develop or Adopt Training Materials**
   - Curate reputable free resources (CISA, NIST, SANS “OUCH!” newsletter).
   - Consider commercial training platforms if budget allows.
   - Encourage interactive sessions such as tabletop exercises and phishing simulations.
3. **Deliver the Training**
   - Short, regular sessions beat annual marathon trainings.
   - Mix mediums: videos, quizzes, hands‑on labs and discussions.
   - Reinforce positive behaviors rather than shaming mistakes.
4. **Measure and Improve**
   - Track completion and quiz scores.
   - Analyze simulated phishing campaign results to identify improvement areas.
   - Solicit feedback and adjust content accordingly.
5. **Create a Culture of Security**
   - Encourage reporting of suspicious activity without fear of reprisal.
   - Celebrate security wins and share lessons learned from near‑misses.
