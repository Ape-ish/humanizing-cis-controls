# Emergency Malware Cleanup Plan

Is your computer slow, acting weird, or flooded with pop-ups? Don't panic, and don't throw it out. Follow this 3-step emergency plan based on **CIS Control 10** to take back control.

### Step 1: Isolate the Patient (2 Minutes)

*The goal is to trap the malware and stop it from spreading or calling home.*

- [ ] **Disconnect from the Internet:** Unplug your ethernet cable or turn off your computer's Wi-Fi.
- [ ] **Restart in Safe Mode with Networking:**
    - **Windows 10/11:** Hold `Shift` while you click Restart. Navigate to `Troubleshoot` > `Advanced options` > `Startup Settings` > `Restart`. When it reboots, press `5` for "Safe Mode with Networking."
    - This starts your PC with only essential drivers, which often prevents malware from running.

### Step 2: Scan and Destroy (10 Minutes)

*The goal is to find and remove the malicious files.*

- [ ] **Run Your Primary Antivirus:** In Safe Mode, open your main anti-malware software (e.g., Windows Defender). Run a **Full Scan**, not a quick scan. Let it finish completely and remove or quarantine everything it finds.
- [ ] **Get a Second Opinion:** Malware can be sneaky. Open a web browser (Safe Mode with Networking allows this) and download a free, reputable, on-demand scanner like Malwarebytes Free. Install and run its scan. It's excellent at finding things others miss. Remove everything it finds.

### Step 3: Reboot and Harden (3 Minutes)

*The goal is to get back to normal and prevent this from happening again.*

- [ ] **Restart Your Computer Normally:** It should now be much faster and cleaner.
- [ ] **Check Your AV:** Make sure your primary antivirus is turned on and set for automatic updates.
- [ ] **Uninstall Suspicious Programs:** Go to "Add or Remove Programs" and uninstall any software you don't recognize.
- [ ] **Change Critical Passwords:** Assume the malware saw your passwords. Go to a DIFFERENT, trusted device (like your phone) and change passwords for your email, banking, and social media accounts.
- [ ] **Disable USB Autorun:** Follow the steps to disable Autorun/Autoplay to prevent reinfection from a USB drive in the future.
